## PREDICT APP

## DESCRIPTION

This app was built with Puppeteer. Predict app is an app designed to predict certain outcomes in a football match using available statistics, the main information it uses is the heah-to-head of the teams (their previous meetings). It analyzes these information and decides if or not both teams will score in the match and also if or not the total goals will be more than 2.

## HOW TO USE

* cd into directory

* Install Puppeteer: npm i puppeteer

* Run: node app.js

After running app.js in the terminal it creates some txt file, then you can open index.html in chrome and click on the buttons to see predictions provided by the app.

Note: if running 'node app.js' in terminal starts but doesn't complete, no worries you will still get the predictions it generated, just open index.html and click on buttons to see predictions.
